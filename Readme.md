# QMenu 

## Project Overview

This project is a Qt-based application that demonstrates basic file handling functionalities. 
It allows users to interact with files, such as creating new files, writing content to them, selecting existing files, reading their content, and displaying it in the user interface.
The application is written in C++ using the Qt framework, providing a cross-platform solution for graphical user interface (GUI) development.

### Features

1. **Creating a File in the Project Directory**
   - Create a new text file in the project directory.
   - If the file already exists, overwrite its content with new data.

2. **Accessing the File**
   - Select a text file using `QFileDialog`.
   - Read the content of the selected text file.

3. **Displaying File Content**
   - Display the content of the selected file in the user interface using Qt widgets.
